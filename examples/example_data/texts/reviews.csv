3,"""This was almost an Amazon First Read's pick for me but I grabbed a different one instead. I couldn't stop thinking about the sample I'd read from it though and ended up buying it anyway and waiting for the December release. Today I remembered I had access to it and started reading and didn't put it down except for two dog potty breaks and a puppy bath. I just finished reading it this afternoon and was so satisfied with the entire book. It kept me on the edge of my seat and had the perfect mix of tension and relief. Thoroughly enjoyed this thriller and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys true crime reads or thriller novels and is looking for another new book to read."" --Meghan Miller (Amazon Reader)","""I don't leave reviews very often, but just finished this book last night. I've read other books by Mr Omer and enjoyed them, but this one - this one is in a class all its own. It starts out pretty laid back but builds as pages turn. I actually had to stay up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it and find out the who what where and why of the abduction. A great read, perhaps because it didn't follow the standard tropes of its genre and consequently surprises the reader as they get drawn in ever deeper to the characters and the story itself.

Way to go Mr. Omer! You managed to totally wreck my sleep patterns - something most books don't accomplish. LMAO"" --Karen DeCrane (Amazon Reader)","""It took me a while at the beginning to piece the non-linear chapters together but once I did, I found this book to be extremely thought-provoking, realistic and trying to figure out who the bad guy was. When I got close to the end, and the romance was beginning I thought oh it's just another case solved now two people fall in love and live happily ever after but it turns out there was a twist to the plot, which Turned out to be another story in itself, and even though they still fell in love at the end, it was one page and wasn't cheesy"" --D. Burton (Amazon Reader)","""Eight-year-old Kathy Stone disappeared from her own yard one day. A year later, she was found on the side of the road. Many suspected that she had died, but everyone wants to know where she has been. Kathy is so traumatized that she no longer speaks. It is up to her therapist, Robin Hart, who, through play therapy, rushes to learn what had happened to poor Kathy, before she is recaptured by her kidnapper. Little by little, Kathy reveals the truth through dolls and toys. Robin is horrified by Kathy's story.

Mike Omer's realistic and well-developed characters take the reader on a journey to discover the truth. This is an intriguing story filled with unexpected twists and turns."" --Sandra (Amazon Reader)","""I realized liked the storyline for the book, it was so good and well written, it literally kept me wanting more, but unfortunately I felt that it began slow, then sped up, and slowed again and the worst part about it was how confusing it was trying to see what character I was reading in the chapter, it would've been nice author wrote “robin” “Kathy” to give some hint, I think that is what bothered me most, over all I loved the book it, a lot of thrill, mystery, and mind games a couple times I knew who the abductor was then I was proven wrong in the end. I'd recommend this book but with notice about the confusion between the back and forth chapters."" --M. Zambrano (Amazon Reader)"
4,"""This book was so much fun to read. I picked it from the list for one of the Kindle challenges and was not disappointed. On the way home from errands one day I wondered what would be next for Millie and Nina. After all, Millie's an ex con and Nina's an ex psych ward patient, so how much trouble could they get into just hanging around the house while Nina's husband Andrew is working. Lots! That's how much.

Right up until the last few pages I was still being surprised. I will miss these characters.

And to steal a line from the ABC hit show NYPD Blue, a detective in Internal Affairs told Detective Bobby Simone that everything is a situation. In this book that's an understatement."" --J. Weston (Amazon Reader)","""At first, I wasn't sure where the story was going - but as I kept reading, I became more and more intrigued. I couldn't put the book down! It went in a completely different direction than what I predicted. Whatever you THINK you know, you don't. I was literally gasping reading it (I was actually quite expressive while reading the entire book lol). This was such a great read. I'm excited to read the rest of the series! You won't be disappointed at all with this one!! Get your copy now!"" --Lenisha (Amazon Reader)","""A down and out young woman gets a dream job with a wealthy family. She is greeted warmly and is quite impressed by the couple and the little daughter. But things aren't as they appear to be. A wife with mental issues, a handsome caring husband, and a bratty child. Hired as a housekeeper and nanny, Millie does her best to handle all the disturbing issues.
I read the book in one day and the twists and turns kept me intrigued…right up to the surprising ending."" --babs (Amazon Reader)","""First novel by Freida McFadden. When I downloaded this book on Kindle Unlimited I didn't realize it was a series. It's a book that doesn't require much thinking and I was hooked from the beginning. I found part 1 and part 2 to be quite predictable but part 3 was a shocker. The twists in this story were good except at the very end then the plot kind of collapses.

It's definitely a popcorn read. It was entertaining, a bit predictable, some light suspense, and an all around easy read with a couple silly parts. I would recommend."" --Mary (Amazon Reader)","""I'm honestly between a 2.5 and a 3 star rating for this book. I thought the story-building was okay but I tended to get annoyed with the main character often. I also was not surprised by any of the “plot twists”, I felt like everything was pretty predictable."" --Mariela M. (Amazon Reader)"
8,"""I absolutely loved learning about the Lords, Ryat and Blakely. Yes the steam and sex was great, and right on par for anyone who loves darker kinks, but the drama and the story was so intriguing. For some readers, I can understand it might be triggering. But as someone who has dealt with some of the triggers in the book, it was empowering reading about a female character choosing and understanding the power that comes with owning what you want sexually. Truly a great read!"" --Jordan (Amazon Reader)","""Not in my normal reading selection but this one is amazing!! I couldn't put it down! Suspense, touch her and die, HEA, strong main characters. I read a few of the reviews before starting bc I was worried about triggers and if the mfc was weak. Yes read the triggers! Is Blakely weak hell no! She starts out quiet and asking questions but Ryat brings out her strength.
They are definitely a poor couple. I couldn't put this one down and soooo many surprises!!"" --ShyRyan Strong (Amazon Reader)","""I have heard so much about this book and series and I kept holding off because a 600 page book is a lot to take on. But this book was so worth the read and I wish I would have sooner. Ryat is not at all what I was expecting him to be. He's possessive and controlling but he's got a hidden sweet side. Surprise twist ending, I honestly think this book could have been longer and not felt like it was too long. I want to know so much more of what happens after this book ends and everything in between with the second epilogue."" --Ashley (Amazon Reader)","""This book was….something. I loved the dark mafia hitmen vibes. It was dark without being too brutal. Don't get me wrong, there were some WTF scenes, but it was still never over the limit. Read the trigger warnings.

The characters all have such a personality! I loved their interactions and dynamics. Both Ryat and Blake were so independent and they truly grew and changed over the course of the book. I loved that they weren't boring.

The one thing I could not get on board with in this book, though, Is that they kept saying song titles/ artists. TBH, I don't care. Give me a playlist at the beginning of the music is so important. Every time one came up I wanted to groan in frustration. Other than that, minus a few kind of noticeable spelling errors/ missing words, this book was a satisfying read."" --Caroline (Amazon Reader)","""I finished it. Almost turned into a DNF about 60% of the way. I was completely content after half of the book was done then it DRAGGED on. Did not need to be 600 pages. Lots of repeating words and guessed plots. Like, yeah there's tons of twists and turns at the end of the book but I was way too tired to care because the beginning was a slow burn.

3/5 stars because I finished it finally. I did like the character relationships in it."" --Calysta Brown (Amazon Reader)"
9,"""This is my 3rd Freida Mcfadden book that I've read and also the 3rd one I haven't been able to put down! I read half of this book in 3 hours. I wanted to space it out and really enjoy it but once I told myself “I'll stop at this chapter” the chapters end in a way where you can't stop! You have to keep reading! She is an amazing author if you love a thriller! I will be reading all of her books and I highly recommend this one! Just when you think you have it figured out… you don't. That's what I love!"" --Courtney Lint (Amazon Reader)","""What can I say about this book other than it kept me guessing on who the killer was. Needless to say I was partly right but I didn't guess correctly. And the Epilogue, oh my gosh! I absolutely loved this book and couldn't but it down because I needed to figure out what was going to happen next. Do not hesitate to read this book. It is awesome!"" --Amazon Customer","""I have never been a fan of reading but I wanted to give it a go again because it's good for your brain and what not and I decided thrillers were something I might be alright with reading. So I started with this one and I did not expect to pick it up and quite literally not put it down. I didn't expect it to make me love reading and I never expected to be able to read all of that in one sitting but I adore the plot twists and I bought 2 more books by Freida McFadden because it was so good! Recommend reading this!!!"" --Tate Youngs (Amazon Reader)","""Yet another book that leaves you guessing until the very end. Her twists always get me. If you like thrillers this is another great, quick read. It'll keep you intrigued to find out who really is at fault."" --Katelynn (Amazon Reader)","""The book is a nice read between other novels. The imagery is a bit redundant and could be a bit better. The main character, Brooke is too swayed by others in my opinion. I rolled my eyes often regarding her naivety."" --Monica (Amazon Reader)"
21,"""Bought this after seeing it online and let me tell you, I was very pleasantly surprised. I was never able to guess where things were going and that's refreshing. The FMC is different than I expected her to be as well, she was almost relatable and I found myself rooting for her more than I usually do. And the twist at the end of the book? Phenomenal. I couldn't put this book down and I cannot wait to tear into the second one."" --Amanda E Cooper (Amazon Reader)","""Simply put, I loved this book. I read the entire thing over the course of 48 hours and never lost interest or became bored with the storyline. That in itself for someone that reads more than 50 books a month is hugely impressive. So for those who devour paranormal romance novels with some gnarly and gruesome vampire carnage...make this book your next adventure, I promise you will not be disappointed. As for myself...I am off to start the next one because I need to know how this love/hate relationship between my newly favorite people ends. Happy Reading."" --Christine S (Amazon Reader)","""Let me start by saying this book is nothing like ACOTAR, I had seen multiple accounts of people's claims Rahin reminded them of Rhys but not even their wings look the same.

The first few chapters took me a while to get into. But once I was in, I couldn't put it down. This book was so exciting and full of plot twists, unexpected turn of events and very morally gray characters. Just how I like it.

Other than the different vampire factions, it doesn't resemble anything I have read before. Highly recommended."" --Monica Restrepo (Amazon Reader)","""The beginning was difficult to get through but once you're immersed in the world of the Moon Palace this book gradually draws you more and more in. Kind of like the slow burn of this romance between the two main characters. Some things I saw coming, others completely shocked me. Overall a very entertaining read, can't wait to start the next one."" --Stacey (Amazon Reader)","""This book was not bad, the world building could have used some work , I felt like oraya was a little to naive and mentally innocent for someone who loves to kill vampires on her off time. Like sis couldn't piece 2+2 for the life of her. I guess after reading characters like rin fang, aelin, manon, and Jude Duarte, Oraya's inner monologue was giving little confused girl. However, pushing that aside, the book was not bad , I enjoyed it, the ending was predictable but the way in which she executed it was shocking and I will be reading the next book"" --Jaz (Amazon Reader)"
23,"""This book did not disappoint!

I was a little worried when I realized it was dual pov (not normally a fan) but Carissa executed it beautifully! This book continues from where we left off in The Serpent and the Wings of Night, book one in the series. I was heartbroken with how the first book ended and was hoping The Ashes and the Star Cursed King would put my heart back together and BOY did it! I love that we get answers to so many questions and the character development for the main characters was fantastic to witness."" --Bre W. (Amazon Reader)","""No spoilers here. But this author understands grief and how grieving people feel and think. The pain the FMC feels about losing her father feels so real to the reader. It made me ugly cry. But the book isn't all sad. It also shows how difficult it is to be vulnerable to another person as the FMC struggles with her feelings for the MMC. The characters are well developed and feel so real. On more than one occasion I felt the author put experiences and feelings into words that perfectly described my real life feelings better than I ever could. This book is an emotional ride but in a good way."" --Country girl (Amazon Reader)","""Amazing plot twist with betrayal and heartbreaking secrets coming to light, epic wars with cruel gods. Beautiful character development, found family and passionate romance in this fantastic and fast paced follow up to The Serpent and the Wings of Night. No doubt the best romantasy of 2023. Can't wait for the next instalment 💙"" --Mrs Maartensson (Amazon Reader)","""I would really like to give it 4.5star, it was not as amazing as the first book where every word counted. Every event mattered. In this book, I just felt the first 48% dragged on with FL being rather childish and ML really didn't take on his royal role. Having said that, the second 52% redeemed the book in my opinion. You really watch the characters grow from the first half the book while facing incredible odds."" --Nousheen H (Amazon Reader)","""The first book was great! I devoured it in a single day! The characters, the plot, the twists and turns, the ending… just great. The second book? Not so much. I couldn't get into it, but I will definitely give it time and try again soon! Carissa is a great author and I wanted to love it! 🫶"" --Caity (Amazon Reader)"
29,"""I absolutely loved this start of the series! The world is introduced: Yggrasil (The tree of life) and along its roots are five different realms with different magic and fae. The humans are slaves in all the realms and the mc is a special kind of slave in the Gold realm. Her kind can wield the magic of gold into staves so that the fae can use magic. One day she gets kidnapped by the shadow court and realizes the world is more than she thought, and filled with more terrors than she could've imagined. She is quickly thrown into a plot of deception and everywhere she goes someone is trying to kill her.
I adored how the author combined the fae world with norse mythology; the names, the gods, the beliefs, Amazing! Can't wait to read the next one! 👏"" --Isabelle (Amazon Reader)","""It kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading this book it could not be put down I devoured it all in one day. Just found a new author that I deeply admire and I'm off to the next book"" --Kindle Customer","""Keeps you on your toes, interesting world, great characters, enjoyable read. High Fantasy at its best. Has some spice but relatable to the story and not overwhelming or taking over the story.
Quick note for the writer, horses don't ""snicker"" they nicker. Could have been an editing typo, but really needs to be fixed."" --Buffalocolt27 (Amazon Reader)","""This is a really good, quick read. I'm certainly hooked and will finish the series but I feel like it could have been longer with a little more detail. It does seem very rushed.
It's very much the “enemies to lovers,” “dark prince,” “fae and human,” “strong, stubborn fmc” trope(s) which is somewhat predictable but not bad. Think of Guild meets ACOTAR meets FBAA. The gold, the stubborn human falling for the enemy fae, the “chosen one.”
I feel like ending on a cliffhanger is definitely utilized to get the reader to continue the next book to make up for how rushed everything else is. Overall, 4/5 and I will be reading on though slightly disappointed."" --Jimmie (Amazon Reader)","""All 4 books are quick reads. There were a few grammar errors, and a few confusing transitions throughout the series. The plot is interesting, but becomes tedious with all the secrets no one can expose. This series has the main FMC having an enemies to (only 1) lover, and there is at least 1 spice scene in each novel. The spice is rated one pepper out of 5. Having undead (or zombie like) creatures in a fae novel was a new one for me."" --Sound Judgement (Amazon Reader)"
45,"""You've likely heard the phrase “chew up the meat and spit out the bones”, in other words, take away the important or relevant bits and leave the rest that don't matter… this book is all meat.
It's short bc it's poignant. Great practical advice and easy to implement."" --Delyn (Amazon Reader)","""Love this book because it doesn't have all the fluff no one cares about. It explains the issue of overstimulation and how you can combat it. There is even workbook pages in the back."" --Daniel Manz (Amazon Reader)","""I feel like this book touched on a lot of issues I experience personally, I didn't know that my experience was so similar to others who procrastinate. The steps in the book are very simple but effective, it's a great read for anyone having trouble doing the tough tasks, that we so often put off."" --Jason (Amazon Reader)","""Author sets up good habits and reasons why overstimulation in todays world is affecting our lives greater than what we can imagine. Author does a good job in raising our consciousness when it comes to social media or anything else involving overstimulation."" --Roy Saenz (Amazon Reader)","""A quick and useful guide to help live a more productive life. Reinforcing what we know about distractions and technology, and how to
overcome its grip on our lives."" --Amanda Magro (Amazon Reader)"
46,"""I enjoyed this quick-read. It was more of an intro to a zen way of thinking, enlightenment. It seemed like a lot of the same words repeating, but nonetheless it was still interesting and an easy read. If you're looking for ways to stop overthinking or are getting into looking for zen, and peacefulness in your mind, this is a good book for you."" --Haley Jean (Amazon Reader)","""I truly felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders after reading this book. Simple and straightforward. To think life could be so simple. Just let go of your thinking and enjoy the present moment. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from overthinking."" --Nefertima (Amazon Reader)","""I love that this author used easy to understand language to explain how our thoughts cause all of our problems! He did a great job using examples and providing steps to help you get on the journey to having a peaceful mind."" --Kindle Customer","""The book is full of valuable information, and the author's enthusiasm to share a path to greater happiness with his readers is clear. I've been trying the practice for three days now, and so far it works. I think I will take a few minutes each morning to go outside and just look/listen...no thinking! A quiet contentment arises when I just allow a ""first thought"" to hang there without commenting. Works with hard emotions too, if you have the guts to resist trying to talk yourself out of them.

The writing isn't elegant, but that's beside the point. Also, the parts about the Universe might be a bit much for someone who hasn't yet investigated reality beyond materialism, but I found it to be enlightening. Thank you Joseph"" --""lparks0111"" (Amazon Reader)","""This is likely most suited to people who are more analytically-minded. For those on the more creative, artistic side - much of the book is nothing new. I can see that for some, it would be valuable - but for me it wasn't ""speaking my language""."" --D. Harrison (Amazon Reader)"
47,"""Thoughtful analysis and great exercises for letting go of the past. I highly recommend using this book whenever you feel drowned by regret."" --Yvonne Tran (Amazon Reader)","""If you're looking to turn the page on your past and move into a healthier state of mind for your future this is a great read. Lots of great tips and exercises to help you move forward from past behaviors that you want to shed."" --trefault (Amazon Reader)","""I've read quite a few books of this genre, but this is the first one I've found that explains how our emotions, once necessary for survival, can work against us, and how to reset thought patterns that are no longer in our best interest. There are numerous exercises, and many of them have examples, making it easy to get started. The book is comprehensive, but I'd love to meet the author and pick his brain even further."" --Kathryn Brooks (Amazon Reader)","""I really enjoyed this book and the lessons. I like that it gave us time frames to focus on the lesson, encouraging us to take our time and not rush through them. I also likes the examples as it helped push my thoughts into gear and to think of more things than I may have on my own. The quotes at the beginning of the chapters were excellent. I saved many of them.
My only negative is some of the content was a little redundant in the chapters. It felt like a few sentences were just reworded to add length."" --William (Amazon Reader)","""This is the second or third book that I read from this author and I found it quite forgettable, just as his other ones. The information is always a personal view and conclusions from the author rather than a researched and backed analysis of the subject being presented. Every piece of advice or information can be derived from common sense with very little insight or novelty for someone with a slightly over average skill for overcoming negative situations. I can't imagine what kind of individual would benefit from this book other than the author himself. I don't recommend this nor other books by this author."" --Ignacio Zamora (Amazon Reader)"
